Seeking a ninth title at his hometown event, and a 99th overall, Federer will play 93th-ranked Marius Copil on Sunday. Federer dominated the 20th-ranked Medvedev and had his first match-point chance to break serve again at 5-1. He then dropped his serve to love, and let another match point slip in Medvedev's next service game by netting a backhand. He clinched on his fourth chance when Medvedev netted from the baseline. Copil upset expectations of a Federer final against Alexander Zverev in a 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-4 win over the fifth-ranked German in the earlier semifinal. The Romanian aims for a first title after arriving at Basel without a career win over a top-10 opponent. Copil has two after also beating No. 6 Marin Cilic in the second round. Copil fired 26 aces past Zverev and never dropped serve, clinching after 2 1/2 hours with a forehand volley winner to break Zverev for the second time in the semifinal. He came through two rounds of qualifying last weekend to reach the Basel main draw, including beating Zverev's older brother, Mischa. Federer had an easier time than in his only previous match against Medvedev, a three-setter at Shanghai two weeks ago.\",\n          \"Nadal has not played tennis since he was forced to retire from the US Open semi-finals against Juan Martin Del Porto with a knee injury. The world No 1 has been forced to miss Spain's Davis Cup clash with France and the Asian hard court season. But with the ATP World Tour Finals due to begin next month, Nadal is ready to prove his fitness before the season-ending event at the 02 Arena. Nadal flew to Paris on Friday and footage from the Paris Masters official Twitter account shows the Spaniard smiling as he strides onto court for practice. The Paris Masters draw has been made and Nadal will start his campaign on Tuesday or Wednesday against either Fernando Verdasco or Jeremy Chardy. Nadal could then play defending champion Jack Sock in the third round before a potential quarter-final with either Borna Coric or Dominic Thiem. Nadal's appearance in Paris is a big boost to the tournament organisers who could see Roger Federer withdraw. Federer is in action at the Swiss Indoors in Basel and if he reaches the final, he could pull out of Paris in a bid to stay fresh for London. But as it stands, Federer is in the draw and is scheduled to face either former world No 3 Milos Raonic or Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round. Federer's projected route to the Paris final could also lead to matches against Kevin Anderson and Novak Djokovic. Djokovic could play Marco Cecchinato in the second round. British No 1 Kyle Edmund is the 12th seed in Paris and will get underway in round two against either Karen Khachanov or Filip Krajinovic.\",\n          \"Maria Sharapova has basically no friends as tennis players on the WTA Tour. The Russian player has no problems in openly speaking about it and in a recent interview she said: 'I don't really hide any feelings too much. I think everyone knows this is my job here. When I'm on the courts or when I'm on the court playing, I'm a competitor and I want to beat every single person whether they're in the locker room or across the net.So I'm not the one to strike up a conversation about the weather and know that in the next few minutes I have to go and try to win a tennis match. I'm a pretty competitive girl. I say my hellos, but I'm not sending any players flowers as well. Uhm, I'm not really friendly or close to many players. I have not a lot of friends away from the courts.' When she said she is not really close to a lot of players, is that something strategic that she is doing? Is it different on the men's tour than the women's tour? 'No, not at all. I think just because you're in the same sport doesn't mean that you have to be friends with everyone just because you're categorized, you're a tennis player, so you're going to get along with tennis players. I think every person has different interests. I have friends that have completely different jobs and interests, and I've met them in very different parts of my life. I think everyone just thinks because we're tennis players we should be the greatest of friends. But ultimately tennis is just a very small part of what we do. There are so many other things that we're interested in, that we do.'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/10/copil-stuns-5th-ranked-zverev-to-reach-swiss-indoors-final/77721/\",\n          \"https://www.express.co.uk/sport/tennis/1037119/Rafael-Nadal-World-No-1-Paris-Masters-Federer-Djokovic\",\n          \"https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Maria_Sharapova/62220/i-do-not-have-friends-in-tennis-says-maria-sharapova/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# A.
